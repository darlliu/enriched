# `enriched`

### Annotation enrichment analysis software in modern C++

This is a personal project that provides a software that addresses the following problem: We know symbols S_i each are assiciated with annotations A_i, given a test set of symbols and a background set, what annotations are over and under represented? Another version of this problem also includes number N_i associated with S_i, or statistics Theta_i associated with S_i.

### Practice in modern C++

This project should utilize all these [good stuff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CppCon/CppCon2019/master/Presentations/back_to_basics_the_best_parts_of_cpp/back_to_basics_the_best_parts_of_cpp__jason_turner__cppcon_2019.pdf) in modern C++.
